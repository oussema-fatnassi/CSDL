# CSDL
Game of Life in C++

Project Game of Life. 
The aim is to achieve this in C++ without using objects and in text mode, we will implement the cellular automaton imagined by John Horton Conway.


# DESCRIPTION
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

It's a program with a main function and a menu at the launch of the game allowing the user to:

1. - Start the game.
2. - Generate a random population.
3. - Start with the default population.
4. - Load a population from a text file.
5. - Save the current population to a text file.
